Hello! My name's Oliver and I was one of the programmers for Pink Coffee Studios who helped create ZeusVR in the Unreal Engine (4.20).
ZeusVR is a game soley built around an endurance run style of experience. Where you, (the player) fight against waves o animated statues which get more and more difficult you progress through each of the waves. 

When creating the game, I helped with the enemy manager and with their spawning cycle. I basically made it so the enemy could spawn from a set location by mapping the spawn function to an object in the editor which can be moved and placed by the designers later on. This was then later modified to spawn different enemy types by my fellow programmer in the team. 

I then worked on the player controller by implementing a system that allows for the weapon to break the menu blocks and proceed to do the function that is written on them. Again, this was later modified in a peer programming session that me and fellow team member held as I needed some help getting it to work.

I also worked on the sound effects for the game. So with this, 
- I made it so the weapon will ring whenever the player uses the grip to change the weapon.
- I made it so the enemies have a death sound effect when struck by the player.
- The music plays only the first sound track once and loops the second.
- I then made it so the shield makes a deflection sound when hit by an arrow to indicate that the player deflected it.
- I also did the ambient sounds so they now play in the background whilst the game runs.
(There were also plans to add voicelines for Zeus but they were later un-able to be put into the final build of the game.)

I did also work on some other side projects for the game in the form of voicelines which were to be used in the game but never got implemented. However, they are still heard in the trailer.
